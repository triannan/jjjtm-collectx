# jjjtm-collectx

ok hey guys

run `./bin/collectxdb reset` to autopopulate a small test account username: jjjtm and password: password 
<br>run `./bin/collectxrun` to run the website locally 

the database is in `var/collectx.sqlite3`
<br> the database schema is in `sql/schema.sql`
<br> the stuff being populated is in `sql/data.sql` so u can add more stuff when testing if u want

ive implemented most things other than filters on the search, directory, and messages/trading

you should be able to make an account, log in, create a new collection, add stuff to it, delete stuff it its urs, search up peoples stuff, view their profile and see their collections, view your own profile and edit your profile, log out
